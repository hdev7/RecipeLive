### Project Description

I spend a lot of time looking for recipes that would match the ingredients I have in my refrigerator.  Sometimes ~30 minutes is spent on google searching, to get the one that's reasonable based on ingredients, prep time, nutritonal values, etc. I often feel that most cooking sites and mobile apps have too many functionalities to navigate through. So, I thought, *"Wouldn't it be nice to have a personalized recipe-finder that simply takes ingredient photos as the input ?"* I wanted to take a stab at this problem, i.e., building a recipe-finder that's personalized to my preferences.
